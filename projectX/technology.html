          <h2>I. The printing press</h2>
          The machine devised by the German Gutenberg in the mid-15th century
          enabled the mass production of books. As a result, it led to the
          spread of ideas (especially religious ones), the spread of knowledge,
          literacy and the creation of libraries in Europe.

          <h2>II. The steam engine</h2>
          It was invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1775 -
          revolutionised transport and machinery in the 19th century and drove
          the First Industrial Revolution, rapidly moving from an economy based
          on agriculture and trade to an industrialised one with much greater
          production capacity.

          <h2>III. The Light Bulb</h2>
          Thomas Edison considered to be inventor of light bulb in 1880. It is
          one of the greatest invention since the discovery of fire: light
          entered homes and workplaces, becoming a necessity and an engine for
          economic growth

          <h2>IV. The telephone</h2>
          Alexander Graham Bell patented this device in 1876, which
          revolutionised communication by allowing instant speech even over long
          distances. Without it, the world would not exist as we know it today:
          it laid the foundations for mobile telephony.

          <h2>V. The aeroplane</h2>
          In 1903, the Wright brothers created the first human-piloted motorised
          aeroplane, the Wright Flyer. This technological ingenuity boosted
          trade, culture, tourism and, today, the air transport industry is key
          to global economic prosperity.

          <h2>VI. The computer</h2>
          The first personal computer with a microprocessor was the Micral
          (1973). Computers have redefined people’s lives and the way they work,
          simplifying tasks, storing information and processing data quickly and
          efficiently.

          <h2>VII. The internet</h2>
          The connection of four university computers to ARPAnet in 1969 was the
          seed for the birth of the Internet. This breakthrough was key to Tim
          Berners-Lee’s introduction of the World Wide Web in 1991, transforming
          society. It continues to evolve today, bringing new forms of
          interaction and economic, social and cultural growth.

          <h2>VIII. The mobile phone</h2>
          In 1983, the first mobile phone small enough to be portable was
          launched: Motorola DynaTac 8000X, designed by engineer Martin Cooper.
          Today it is one of the essential technological inventions in personal
          and professional life.

          <h2>IX. Artificial intelligence</h2>
          The precursor of modern computing, Alan Turing, is also the father of
          artificial intelligence. However, the term was not coined until 1956,
          when the first artificial intelligence programme, Logic Theorist.
          Today, this technological invention has crept into our lives in the
          form of chatbots, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, real-time
          translators, ChatGPT, IoT.
